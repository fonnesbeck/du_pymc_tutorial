# Getting Started with PyMC v5

## Data Umbrella Tutorial Syllabus

### Course Description
This one-hour tutorial introduces new users to version 5 of PyMC, a powerful Python library for probabilistic programming and Bayesian statistical modeling. Participants will learn the fundamentals of PyMC, best practices for installation and setup, and gain hands-on experience building their first Bayesian model.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, participants will:
- Understand what PyMC is and when to use it
- Know how to properly install and configure PyMC
- Understand the difference between probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference
- Be able to build and diagnose a simple Bayesian model
- Know where to find resources for continued learning
